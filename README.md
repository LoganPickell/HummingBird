This was my final project in Artificial Intelligence.

This was my very first exposure to Unity, but I've been a gamer for years.

I followed a unity tutorial to create an ML hummingbird agent to collect nectar from the flowers.

This agent learned to stay within the boundaries, how to navigate, and efficient techniques to collect the sweet sweet nectar.
